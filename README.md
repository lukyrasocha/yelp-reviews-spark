# Large Scale Data Analysis

## Description

In 2019, an [interesting study](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap) looked into the use of the word "authentic" in Yelp reviews and how it was used to signal different characteristics from cuisine to cuisine. They found that, for example, in Chinese and Mexican restaurants, the word was used to describe typically negative things like "dirty", "kitsch" or "cheap", where Italian and French restaurants used to signal high quality and delicious details. The author sees this tendency as harmful, trapping non-white restaurant-owners in negative stereotypes.

## Assignment

Test the study by analysing large scale data (yelp reviews) using `spark` as a part of the LSDA course at [IT University of Copenhagen](www.itu.dk)
